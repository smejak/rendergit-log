# rendergit-log
Render the commit history of any repo in a single static HTML (inspired by Karpathy's rendergit).

> Just show me the diffs.

`rendergit-log` is based on [rendergit](https://github.com/karpathy/rendergit), but instead of flattening files, it flattens a repositoryâ€™s **commit history** into a single static HTML page. Get an instant, clickable list of commits on the left; click any commit to see the **diff against its previous commit** on the right.

Perfect for quick historical code review, skimming what changed, and instant Ctrl+F across patches.

## Basic usage

Install and run (using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) or pip):

```bash
# local editable install
pip install -e .

# or with uv
uv tool install .
